WIMB (Where is My Book) website.

This allows a user to download a QRcode for a book they own and then
sell or give away that book and if someone then scans the QRcode and
registers they have the book and their location, the user can see
where it's gone.

If a subsequent user also registers they also get to track it.

Users can scan the ISBN barcode of their book and register it (if
they have an account on the site), they can also catalogue their
book collection (paid feature).

Adults can register sub-accounts for their children to track their
books they give away/sell too.
